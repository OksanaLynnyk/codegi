      is a coding-inspired logic game designed for absolute beginners. Instead
      of typing code, players build logic flows using intuitive visual blocks to
      control characters, unlock doors, navigate mazes, and solve
      real-world-inspired challenges. The game offers a friendly introduction to
      basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions,and
      sequencesâ€”without requiring any prior coding experience. Whether you're a
      curious kid, a parent looking for an educational game, or a teacher
      seeking interactive tools, CodeGI opens the door to computational thinking
      through fun.
